# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

## Description

As a full-stack web developer, I expect to be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. Since a typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges, I challenged myself to create my own multiple choice quiz on JavaScript fundamentals.

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written myself. I have provided a clean, polished, and responsive user interface so that other users may also benefit from my preparations.

## Tasks 

### User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
