# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

## Description

As a full-stack web developer, I expect to be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. Since a typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges, I challenged myself to create my own multiple choice quiz on JavaScript fundamentals.

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written myself. I have provided a clean, polished, and responsive user interface so that other users may also benefit from my preparations.

## Tasks 

### User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
